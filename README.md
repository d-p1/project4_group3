BACKGROUND:
      Welcome to a journey into the dynamic world of stocks, where we embark on an exploration of financial data and market trends with the overarching question in mind: What would My Rich dad do? In this project, we delve into the intricacies of stock market behavior, employing a multifaceted approach to analyze historical data from the renowned NASDAQ.

Key Objectives:
1. Historical Data Retrieval: Our first step involves sourcing comprehensive historical data on the NASDAQ, unraveling the past to glean insights into market patterns and trends.
Data Cleaning with Pandas: Harnessing the power of Python's pandas library, we meticulously clean and organize the dataset, ensuring accuracy and reliability in our subsequent analyses.
Database Analysis with PostgreSQL: Leveraging the capabilities of PostgreSQL, we delve into the data to uncover meaningful patterns, correlations, and anomalies that may guide us in understanding the market's ebb and flow.
Data Visualization with Tableau: The narrative unfolds visually as we utilize Tableau to create intuitive and insightful visualizations. These visual representations will offer a clearer understanding of the data and help in identifying potential investment opportunities.
Unsupervised Machine Learning: Our exploration extends into the realm of machine learning, employing unsupervised algorithms to predict market trends. Can we unveil the secret sauce that could lead to wealth generation?
Understanding Market Dynamics:
Average Days: What does an ordinary day in the stock market look like? We analyze the routine, the expected, and the patterns that characterize the stock market on an average day or week.
Eventful Days: How do stocks react to significant events? We scrutinize the impact of extraordinary occurrences on the market, seeking patterns that may guide us in navigating turbulent times.
